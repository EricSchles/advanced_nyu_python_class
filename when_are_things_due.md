* HackerRank assignments are due the friday after they have been assigned (with the exception of the first class).

* project benchmarks are due the following monday.

For example, for week one:

The assignment is due June 9th and the project milestone is due June 12th.

The second assignment is due the following Friday, aka June 16th and so on and so forth.

All assignments start on the day the project of the previous sprint is due.

So, Assignment 2 starts on June 12th.  

Late policy:

_Technically_ everything is due at the end of the semester, which means - you can either get ahead or leave things till the last minute.  There will be no grade assignments (other than the projects), during the semester.

Projects will be graded throughout the semester though, so please get those done promptly no matter what.
